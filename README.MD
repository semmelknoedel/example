There are tapes from different artists, all can do the same thing (play songs) but they do it differently (different lyrics). The idea is to make the exchange of the chosen artist as easy as possible and without a lot of changes in the existing code. The artist could also be defined through a a config-file or via argv, for example.

This package uses boost variant and visitor.
